# Welcome! :D

## Hand-View-Controller
- This was a senior group project where the work was split between different people.
- Our project was to make a LiDAR Aided Vision Device that would give haptic feedback to a visually-impaired user to tell them where object were in the environment in front of them.

- My work can be found in Hand-View-Controller > src > main.cpp
  - This code was resonsible for running our motors on our project using an arduino board and the accellstepper library
  - NOTE: Many of the commits contain a different user that was in the group. I often was using their computer during coding sessions so their name appears for the commits.
